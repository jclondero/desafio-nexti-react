# Nexti React Challenge

The Nexti React Challenge was held in order to test my skills using React.js. The project was totally idealized focusing on best practices using a library.

## Visit [desafio-nexti-react.vercel.app](https://desafio-nexti-react.vercel.app) for view the application!

## Install Dependencies

Use the NPM to install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

## Fake database

All system data is fakes. The moved data can be found inside the API folder. If you want to execute the project and see only the graphic part, there is a registered user in the database.

```bash
